# INTRODUCTION

- “Foodie”, A Food Home Delivery Web App, is a restaurant specific Home delivery system. It is aimed to cater a restaurant’s, food court’s personal home delivery needs.
- We are in the era, were apps like Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats etc are dominating the market. However, Brands like Dominos, McDonalds, Pizza hut, Burger King etc have a personal system which provide them brand value, independency etc which is still a dream and a matter of pride for many.
- Foodie full fills this need, it connects a local food store to the customers. A user can register and add the items to the cart, proceed with the payments and enjoy favourite food at home with friends and family.

# WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO BUILD?

We are trying to build a platform which is a restaurant specific Food Home delivery Application. It is aimed to cater a restaurant’s / food court’s personal home delivery needs.
It will be a place where a restaurant or food court can row its business by being independent, building its brand and working on its own terms and catering to the needs of people visiting store remotely.
The users also get benefited from this service as they don’t have to wait at stores long for the order, and they get it delivered at home.

As of now, the app will have:

- • A dashboard Showing what a restaurant have in kitchen as Menu Items.
- • A Signup / Login Page,
- • A dashboard Showing what a restaurant have in kitchen.
